*Traffic Light Project

*Components:
In the project we used:
3 GPIO Ports (D,E,F)
2 Timer (Timer0,Timer1)
UART 	(UART0)

*Variables:
x => used as counter for cars traffic lights
flag => used for handling delay of pedestrian ISR
t => used in for loop to make pedestrian light for 2 sec
(statflagN,statflagE,statflagPN,statflagPE)=>check UART print state

*functions:
printchar=>send characters to UART0 to print on terminal
print=> take string of charachters and print it using printchar
GPIOPortF_Handler=> Interrupt service routine for buttons
Timer0A_Handler=> Interrupt service routine for cars traffic lights
Timer1A_Handler=> Interrupt service routine for delaying the call 
of pedestrian after called before
GPIOF_init=> intialization of portf and buttons
GPIOD_init=> intialization of portD and leds
GPIOE_init=> intialization of portE and leds
Timer0in=> intialization of Timer0
Timer1in=> intialization of Timer1
UARTin => intialization of UART0

*Description:

*in the main.c file we called the initialization functions
and an empty while loop for the code

*in the projectfunction.c file we wrote the Initialization
functions for each PORT and Timer and the UART

*we also used the GPIO_PORTF_handler as the ISR for the buttons
of the pedestrian

*Timer0_handler was used as the ISR for the cars light traffic
of the NORTH SOUTH and the EAST WEST with a priority lower
than GPIO_PORTF to be able to PORTF to make a preemption
and serve PORTF's ISR

*Timer1 was used for the timing of the pedestrian lights

*Timer1_handler was the ISR used for handling the delay of
calling the pedestrian lights again after finishing it by
a delay of 1 second

*UART0 was used for printing the state of the Traffic lights
on the terminal of our computer

*Implementation

*first the green light of North south light for 5 sec
then yellow for 2 sec then red
after red light 1 sec green of EAST WEST light
for 5 sec then yellow for 2 then red then wait
1 sec then cycle repeats
*If pedestrian pushed the button the pedestrian
light turns green for 2 sec then turns red
*cars green light will be paused from its time position
then return to complete its remaining time after red of 
pedestrian light

*Handling:

1-If two pedestrian push at same time only the one with 
cars light green will interrupt hte cars light and open
its green pedestrian light
2-if a pedestrian push more than once during the period
of green pedestrian light it will not iterrupt again
but will light the green for only 2 seconds
3- delay was put to stop pedestrian from using button
again just after the pedestrian red lights instead
he will have to wait for 1 sec to use the button again
