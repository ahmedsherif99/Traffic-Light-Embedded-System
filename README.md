# Traffic-Light-Embedded-System
A Traffic light control system using Cortex M4 This project is implemented using ARM microcontoller, Tiva C borad tm4c123gh, to control a traffic light.The traffic is controlled using the the 2 push buttons and the LEDs built on the board. This projects uses UART to show the status of the the traffic light on a serial monitor, Putty. The projects implements the idea of interrupts, UART and GPIO ports on the Tiva C board.  
The compiler used is IAR workbench
